===============Known issues======================
If you harvest a regrowing crop, checking it again will still say it's ready to be harvested
	before you harvest, it may also say X days till harvest


===============Future Plans=====================

Move away from having to press a key to find out info and towards something that is always visible
	likely keep the key to find out the type

Add in information about the crop being watered or not

animal info?

move strings into another file, so that others can translate

show crop/fruit icon?
